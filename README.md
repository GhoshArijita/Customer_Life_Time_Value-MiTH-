CUSTOMER LIFETIME VALUE PREDICTION

I have completed my Post Graduate Program in Data Science from International School of Engineering (INSOFE) in the month of January 2020.
As a part of the curriculum, there was a Mid-Term Hackathon (MiTH) organized. 
The problem statement was to predict the customer lifetime value for an auto-insurance company using regression. 
The data sets provided were two .csv files: "train-1574429526318.csv" and "test-1574429501088.csv"

Have a look at the Python notebook that I created. Hope it helps! :)
